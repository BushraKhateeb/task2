<p>Hello, my name is Bushra, and I'm 21 years old. I am currently studying
    Computer Systems Engineering at the Arab American University, in my third year
    of studies. I have a strong interest in broadening my knowledge across various
    fields. I enjoy exploring new things, trying different cuisines, and volunteering. 
    Developing my personality and striving to lead a successful life as a Muslim are 
    important goals for me :)</p>
